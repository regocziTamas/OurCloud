# OurCloud

## Welcome to OurCloud!

OurCloud is my current pet project that I do in my free time. In short, it is a Google Drive clone, meaning that users can upload their files on the server, manage and organize them into folders, and also download them on any device with an active internet connection. The project uses Spring Boot on the backend, with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer, Angular 9 on the frontend, and it is served by an Nginx server running on a Raspberry Pi 4 on my desk. The site is available at <https://www.rtamas.com>, you can try it out by logging in as "Guest01" and using "yxcv1234" as password. However, your changes may not be permanent, as the project is still in development.
